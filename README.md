React and GraphQL

- I'm using NVM to manage versions for this install - using node v12.19.0 (npm v6.14.8).
- if you are using NVM you can simply run `nvm use --lts` to match the version above.
- if you haven't got the above version installed you nac run `nvm install 12.19.0` before you proceed
- run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- run `yarn build` 
- run from `/src/` - `node server.js` - Authentication
- run from the root folder `npm start`
- Done ... you are good to go :) 
- navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project
